# General statistics
This query shows general statistics about the application, organized as a table.

The query shows the number of namespaces making up the application, the number of files, header files, C files, CPP files, classes, structures, unions, and functions, and the total number of source code resp. comment lines.

The self-containedness measure indicates how much the application depends on third-party libraries: low self-containedness means that many dependencies are to library classes (as opposed to source classes within the same application).

The results of this query are purely informative and more useful for getting an overall impression of the application than for identifying particular problems with the code.
