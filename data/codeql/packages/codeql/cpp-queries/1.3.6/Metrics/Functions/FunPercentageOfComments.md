# Comment ratio per function
This metric measures the percentage of lines in an function that contain a comment or are part of a multi-line comment.

Having a low comment ratio is an indication that a function does not have sufficient documentation.


## Recommendation
Start by adding documentation to functions that are used from other parts of the code. Then document large complex functions, as they benefit most from documentation.
