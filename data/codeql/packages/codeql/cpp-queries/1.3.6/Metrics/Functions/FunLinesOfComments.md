# Lines of comments per function
This metric measures the number of lines of comments in a function.

Functions that have too few comments are more likely to be insufficiently documented. Long, complex functions that have no comments at all require particular scrutiny, as these are more likely to need explicit documentation in comments.


## Recommendation
Functions with few to no comments should be examined to see if they require documentation. Particular attention should be given to long, complex functions.
