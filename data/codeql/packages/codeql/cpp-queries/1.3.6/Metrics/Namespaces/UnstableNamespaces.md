# Unstable namespaces
This query finds namespaces that have an instability higher than 0.8.

Instability is a measure of how likely a package is to be influenced by changes to other packages. If this metric value is high, a package is easily influenced. If the values is low, the impact of changes to other packages is likely to be minimal. Instability is estimated as the number of outgoing dependencies relative to the total number of dependencies.
