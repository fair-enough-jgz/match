# Number of todo/fixme comments per file
This metric measures the number of TODO or FIXME comments in the code.

These comments tend to document points of ambiguity in the software's requirements. Often they refer to corner-cases that are not handled or potential defects. It is therefore very important to monitor such comments and, where appropriate, escalate comments to an defect-tracking system or other means of ensuring that action is taken.


## Recommendation
Remove unnecessary TODO/FIXME comments, and those that are no longer relevant. File tickets for the remaining comments in a defect-tracker, or otherwise ensure that someone is responsible for fixing them.
