# Percentage of comments
This metric measures the percentage of lines in a file that contain a comment or are part of a multi-line comment.

Having a low percentage of comments is an indication that a file does not have sufficient documentation. Undocumented code is hard to understand, modify, and reuse.


## Recommendation
Add documentation to files with a low percentage of comments. It is most useful to start documenting the public functions first.
