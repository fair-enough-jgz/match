# Lines of code in files
This metric measures the number of lines of code in a file. This excludes comments and blank lines.

Having too many lines of code in a file is an indication that it can be split into several files of more manageable size. Generated code is a notable exception to this.


## Recommendation
Long files should be examined to see if they can be split into smaller, more cohesive files.
