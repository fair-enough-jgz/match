# Lines of comments in files
This metric measures the number of lines of comments in a file.

Files that have too few comments are more likely to be insufficiently documented. Long files that have no comments at all require particular scrutiny, as these are more likely to need explicit documentation in comments.


## Recommendation
Files with few to no comments should be examined to see if they require documentation. Particular attention should be given to long files.
